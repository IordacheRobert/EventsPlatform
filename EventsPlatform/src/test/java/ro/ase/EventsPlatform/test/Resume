Through this program I got the chance to put in practice the knowledge gained in college and even more. 


â€ƒ
During the first three months I learned about java core, JDBC, Hibernate, MVC (Model  View Controller) and Swing. After that I developed a library management system that aims to help people in books renting. During the internship I become familiar also with servlets, sockets, JSP, Tomcat server, multithreading and design patterns. The internship was designed to last one year with the possibility at every three months to extend another three months according the evaluation.
